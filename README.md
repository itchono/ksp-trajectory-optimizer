## Trajectorize
KSP Trajectory Optimizer.

This project is a reduced-scope version of [one of my other (currently incomplete) projects](https://github.com/itchono/gravity-assist-flyby-optimizer), as an intermediate stepping stone.

This tool computes trajectories between celestial bodies in KSP based on on-rails two-body patched conics, incorporating trajectory correction maneuvers for a variety of mission scenarios, such as:
* Ballistic Hohmann transfers for other planets
* Gravity assist flyby routes
